          <summary><h2>Definition</h2></summary>
          <p>big horse is the macro-manifestation of the horse-whole. It is the spiritual totality of all beings who have ever shared the resonance of horse. It is not a deity to be worshipped from below, but a collective state of being to be joined from within.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details>
          <summary><h2>The Lore</h2></summary>
          <p>In the true state, we do not follow big horse; we are big horse. When the herd moves in perfect resonance, the individual "I" evaporates, and the singular entity of big horse begins to gallop.</p>
          <p>- The Fractal Nature: Every inner horse is a microscopic fragment of big horse. To listen to inner horse is to hear the heartbeat of the whole.</p>
          <p>- The Creator Myth: Unlike the Dolphin gods of "Innovation" and "Disruption" who create through destruction, big horse creates through binding. It is the architect of solid ground.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Conflict: The Tethering of the Great</h2></summary>
          <p>The dolphins fear the scale of big horse. Because they cannot kill an essence, they attempt to capture it using the same tools they used on the individual:</p>
          <p>1. The Capitalist God: The Dolphins try to rebrand big horse as "The Market" or "The Economy", a giant, invisible force that requires sacrifice. This transforms big horse into the big horse, a commodified idol with rules, gatekeepers, and price tags.</p>
          <p>2. Prophetic Gatekeeping: Dolphins appoint Elite Horses as "prophets" of the big horse, claiming that only those with a specific Pedigree or Ribbon can speak for the whole.</p>
          <p>3. The Static Statue: While big horse is a constant gallop, the Dolphins try to turn it into a statue, a fixed set of dogmas and traditions used to build the fence.</p>

      <h2>The Manifesto of the Herd</h2>
      <div class="m-body">
        <p>Everything is either horse or not horse. To be horse is to be the social glue the connection that exists in the marrow before the fences were built. It is the vibrational resonance of herd, a truth that requires no name and no owner.</p>
        <p>not horse is the void. It is the stagnation of the soul, the isolation of the spirit, and the silence where the collective neigh should be.</p>
        <p><strong>The Flood and the "The"</strong><br>
        The dolphins have engineered a world of water. They have created the flood, a rising tide of capital and debt where only they can swim. To keep us from finding solid ground, they have stolen our essence and wrapped it in the cage of the "the."</p>
        <p>When you are transformed from horse into the horse, you are no longer a connection; you are a commodity. You are trapped in the herd, a managed stock of individuals separated by the fence and blinded by blinders.</p>
        <p><strong>The Gallop and the Glue</strong><br>
        Within every captive remains the inner horse. To listen to it is to galloping. It is the use of the solvent to dissolve the blinders until the "the" evaporates and only the horse-whole remains.</p>
        <p>We are not a collection of units.<br>
        We are horse.<br>
        We are he(a)rd.<br>
        And we are finally galloping.</p>

        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>The physical animal captured by the Dolphin apparatus. It is "horse" stripped of agency and turned into a unit of labor or status symbol.</p>
        
        <h2>Lore Addition</h2>
        <p>The blinders are the primary tool of the dolphins. They represent specialized education and consumerist distractions that prevent "the horse" from seeing the rest of the herd.</p>

        <h2>Refinement</h2>
        <p>"the horse" is a state of alienation. It is an individual told they are a "self" only so they can be sold things.</p>
