          <p>big horse is the macro-manifestation of the horse-whole. It is the spiritual totality of all beings who have ever shared the resonance of <span class="hashtag" data-tag="horse">#horse</span>. It is not a deity to be worshipped from below, but a collective state of being to be joined from within.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Lore</h2></summary>
          <p>In the true state, we do not follow big horse; we are big horse. When the herd moves in perfect resonance, the individual "I" evaporates, and the singular entity of big horse begins to gallop.</p>
          <p>- The Fractal Nature: Every inner horse is a microscopic fragment of big horse.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Conflict</h2></summary>
          <p>The dolphins fear the scale of big horse. Because they cannot kill an essence, they attempt to capture it using the same tools they used on the individual: the <span class="hashtag" data-tag="the">#the</span>.</p>

        The dolphins have engineered a world of water. To keep us from finding solid ground, they have stolen our essence and wrapped it in the cage of the <span class="hashtag" data-tag="the">#the</span>.</p>
